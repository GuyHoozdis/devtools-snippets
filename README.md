# devtools-snippets

Utilities and helpers for [Chrome DevTools][devtools-snippets].

## Resources


Chrome DevTools

 - [Keyboard Shortcuts][devtools-shortcuts]
 - [DevTools Snippets][devtools-snippets] - an alternative to [Bookmarklets][bookmarklets] and what got me started on this adventure.
 - [DevTools Plugins][devtools-plugins] - has someone already done VIM bindings?
 - [Web Starter Kit][devtools-web-starter-kit] - an opinionated boilerplate for web development.
 - [Polymer Starter Kit][devtools-polymer-starter-kit] - is a starting point for building apps using a drawer-based layout.
 - [Integrating][devtools-integrating] with DevTools

After I created this repo, I discovered these resources:

 - A [package][npm-distributed-snippets] of snippets distributed through NPM.
 - Just [some dudes snippets][some-dudes-snippets].


### Other browsers

I haven't looked at the functionality, the equivelant of DevTools, that
FireFox, IE, Safari, Opera, ... provide.  I'll have to look into that.


## Goals for this project:

This is just an opportunity, and an excute, for me to play around with technologies
that I don't get to use very often.

Some lofty ideas that I would like to get to eventually:

 - Create a GitHub site for this project.
   - Perhaps leverage that interface to install Bookmarklet versions of the snippets.
   - Just to learn about this functionality, because I've been wanting to do that.
 - Create a plugin for DevTools.  I'm all about those VI bindings.
   - I just googled it for the first time.
   - This guy did _[something][devtools-vim-bindings]_.  I'll have to check it out.
   - Several years ago there was a [feature request][chromium-feature-request].

   "Supporting vi edit is a significant effort with very limited interest. Closing as won't fix.  
     -- pfeldman@chromium.org"

   - [Nemesis](https://www.google.com/search?q=pfeldman+chromium)
 - Create a package.json
   - Testing entry point
   - Installation mechanism
